### Spell Me - A VR educational game to help students practice spelling 
In this project we have created a VR game that helps students practice sounding out and spelling words. This project is targeted specifcally for students with dyslexia or students new to the English language. An AI agent will walk the player through practice rounds of teaching the student how to break words into syllables and write the correct letters and then the student will be tested on their knowlege. The AI agent provides the user with instructions on how to navigate the scene and practice in each round (AI agent can be accessed by pointing the laser to the instruction text boxes). 

When you first start the game there will be a practice zone on the left and a test zone on the right. Use your controller to navigate to the practice zone by using the joystick to move forward. You can also teleport to each zone pad by aiming towards the pad with your hand and using the grab button ('g' on simulator, inner grip trigger on Quest). In the practice zone area you will see an object that you are going to spell (object will be located to the left). Using the whiteboards, sound out all of the syllables in that word. For each syllable, grab the corresbonding whiteboard with your controller. This will lead to mini whiteboards appearing in front of you/the text on the whiteboards disappearing. Then grab the marker using the controller and the 'g' button (marker is located on the right side of the practice zone) and write the correct letter for each syllable in the whiteboard in front of you. Click the "Restart" button to clear the whiteboards and try again. Once you have had enough practice, then you can move to the test zone.

If you feel that the AI agent has made a mistake in spelling, syllabification, or pronunciation, feel free to use the feedback button to report any issues.

To move to the test zone, use the joystick to walk to the other side of the room or grab the teleportation pad. In the test zone you will have to type out the correct spelling for the object in front of you (the same object you have just practiced before). Tap on the keys of the board using the inner button on the controller or the 'g' button on the simulator and then press "enter" when you are done. The word will glow green if you spelled it correctly, and red otherwise. Note the use of haptics throughout the game: when you click, grab the whiteboard marker, press keys, or hit enter, the controllers will vibrate to provide user with feedback/indicate that an action has been made. If you have successfully spelled the word you can click the "Next Word" button to move to the next word. If you have not spelled the word correctly you can try again or move back to the practice zone for more practice. 

Note: For HW3 we have just added the locomotion, keyboard, and whiteboard objects. The other functionalities outlined here will be added in HW4.
