### Spell Me - A VR educational game to help dyslexic students practice spelling 
In this project we have created a VR game that helps students practice sounding out and spelling words. An AI agent will walk the player through practice rounds of teaching the student how to break words into syllables and write the correct letters and then the student will be tested on their knowlege. 

When you first start the game there will be a practice zone on the left and a test zone on the right. Use your controller to navigate to the practice zone by pointing to the practice zone pad and pressing 'g'. This will use locomotion to teleport you to the practice zone area. In the practice zone area you will see an object that you are going to spell. Sound out all of the syllables in that word and for each syllable tap on your controller. This will lead to mini whiteboards appearing in front of you. Then grab the marker using the controller and the 'g' button and write the correct letter for each syllable in the whiteboard in front of you. Click the "Restart" button to clear the whiteboards and try again or if you have had enough practice then you can move to the test zone.

To move to the test zone use your controller to point to the test zone pad and press 'g' to teleport there. In the test zone you will have to type out the correct spelling for the object in front of you (the same object you have just practiced before). Tap on the keys of the board using the controller and 'g' button and then press enter when you are done. If you have successfully spelled the word you can click the "Next Word" button to move to the next word. If you have not spelled the word correctly you can try again or move back to the practice zone for more practice.
